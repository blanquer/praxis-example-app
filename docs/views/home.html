  <h1>Blogger Example API</h1>
</div>

<p>
Blogger is a simple API that allows simple management of Blogs, Posts and their Authors.
</p>

<p>
While originally inspired by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/blogger">Google Blogger API</a>, it is only meant to be a simple (and nowhere near feature-complete) example of a Praxis application,
simply to demonstrate some of the various available features of the framework.
</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

There is currently no authentication mechanism for using this API.

<h2>Using the API</h2>

<p>
Currently, the Blogger API only offers a 1.0 version, exposed as a path prefix.
</p>

<p>
You can issue requests directly against the Blogger API with your favorite HTTP tool. This is an example of <code>show</code> request
for the "default" view of a Blog (assuming you have the app running on port 9292 of localhost):
</p>

Request using Curl:
<pre><code>curl -X GET https://localhost:9292:/api/v1.0/blogs/1</code></pre>

Response from the API:
<pre><code>
